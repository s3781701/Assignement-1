								<h2 class="major">Interests</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src=""alt="" /></span>
								<p>•	My interest in IT sparked as a young child, I’ve always been fascinated by technology and its advancement, my passion about coding and creating programs comes from mainly from TV shows and movies, as most of my favourite characters are programmers and have inspired me to become like them. My IT journey started about 3 years ago when I first started coding and I started with HTML, then followed by C#, Visual Basic and currently Java.
</p>
								<p>•	I chose to come to RMIT as I have heard a lot of great things from post-graduate IT students, and their experience lead me to choose RMIT as my first choice </p>
<p>                           •	I expect to learn how to program, how to create UI’s, how to create proper security and firewalls for program, etc…</p>

								<h4> Motivation </h4>	
										<p> This project motivates me a lot since “buzzfeed” media is one of the most successful companies currently out there, it has a net worth of over a billion dollars. Which I mean is very motivating numbers to see and aspire to have. This company/service, can bring a lot of help and services to people and can bring them up to date with all the recent stuff that is going on out there in the world, in a more entertaining way rather than it resembling something of like a boring news company, this will also help lots of people with various skills to have jobs.
